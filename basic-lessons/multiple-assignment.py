# Multiple Assignment allows us to assign multiple variables at the same time using one line of code

#name = "Brian"
#age = 26
#attractive = True

name, age, attractive = "Brian", 26, True

print(name + " " + str(age) + " " + str(attractive))

#spongebob = 30
#patrick = 30
#sandy = 30
#squidward = 30

spongebob = patrick = sandy = squidward = 30

print(spongebob, patrick, sandy, squidward)
